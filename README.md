## 👋🏻 Hi there, I'm [Woongyeong Yeo](https://wgcyeo.github.io).

I'm an undergraduate student at [School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr), [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en). I am currently working as an undergraduate research intern at [MLAI Lab](https://www.mlai-kaist.com), advised by [Prof. Sung Ju Hwang](http://www.sungjuhwang.com), with a strong research focus on multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

### 📌 Pinned Repositories

Here are a few highlights of my work:

- 🔍 [UniversalRAG](https://github.com/wgcyeo/UniversalRAG) – A novel RAG framework that retrieves across multiple modalities and granularities by introducing a modality-aware routing mechanism that dynamically selects the most appropriate corpus for each query
- 🎥 [VideoICL](https://github.com/KangsanKim07/VideoICL) – A novel video in-context learning framework for OOD video understanding tasks that extends effective context length without incurring high costs
